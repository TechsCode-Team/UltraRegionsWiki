# trouble shooting guide!

This is a little guide on a commen problem of users from Ultra Regions.

<br />

## Example:
So you want to make players disablow block breaking and staff allow block breaking?
First add the block breaking flag set this flag to disallow and give it no permission.

Than add the flag again and set it to allow but this time add a permission.
For example: region.testregion.blockbreaking
What this does is everyone that has the permission region.testregion.blockbreaking will be able to break blocks. (This permissions can be anything you want)
