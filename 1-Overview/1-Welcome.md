# Welcome!

Thanks for choosing *Ultra Regions*!
After installing you just need to add the ``ultraregions.admin`` permission to yourself and execute **/uregions**.

<br />

Now you can manage worlds, create regions and add flags to them.
Be aware that you need to create your own permissions on adding a flag to a region.
