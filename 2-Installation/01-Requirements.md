# Server Requirements
For Ultra Regions to run smoothly **SpigotMC, PaperMC** or **[a similar fork](https://github.com/SpiritenHasArrived/MC/blob/main/Server_Side/server_jars.md#bukkit--a-z)** will be required. To ensure you have the best performance possible, we recommend using **[PaperMC](https://papermc.io/downloads)**.
<br>

## Server Version
Ultra Regions is supported on all versions (release) from **1.8.8 to 1.18.X**. Versions under 1.8 and every pre-release/snapshot will not receive any support.
<br>

**`NOTE:` Our plugins do not officially support offline-mode!**
