# Overview
Ultra Regions already has some basic features but these features can be expanded with addons. Addons are additional options to the plugin made by other users.

**How to add addons?**
Adding addons is very simple. 
First you need enter the main GUI of Ultra Regions. In the middle of the GUI there will be a minecart with a chest called addons. In this menu you see the **Marketplace** (where you can add addons) and an **Installed** button (All installed addons). If you would like to add an addon head over to the Marketplace and select the addons you want to use.
If you would like to remove an addon you need to go the Installed section and remove the addon from there.

**NOTE:**
Some addons are not made by our development team; therefore you need to ask in our Support Discord server to get help with those addons.
