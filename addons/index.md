# Addons
Ultra Regions already has some basic flags but you can enhance your usage of this plugin by installing addons. These addons have been made by buyers of Ultra Regions. This is a great way to increase your possibilities with this plugin.
<br>

## How can I install new addons?
Installing addons is very simple. 
By opening Ultra Regions's GUI (using `/uregions`) and clicking on the Chest Minecart. You will see the **Marketplace** (Represented by an Emerald, and where you can install addons) and an **Installed** button (Represented by a Hopper Minecart, and where you can see all your installed addons).
<br>

If you would like to install an addon, head over to the Marketplace and select the addon you want. Click on it and it will be installed automatically.
<br>

If you would like to remove an addon, head over to the Installed section there you can remove a addon by hovering the addon and pressing "Q".
<br>

## Are those addons free?
Yes they're, all of the addons found in the Marketplace are free.

**`NOTE:` These addons are not created by TechsCode Team. If you have a problem with them, either uninstall them or reach out to the author (all of the authors are in our Discord).**
