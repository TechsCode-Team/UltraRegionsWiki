# Server Requirements
For Ultra Regions to run smoothly **SpigotMC, PaperMC** or **[a similar fork](https://github.com/SpiritenHasArrived/MC/blob/main/Server_Side/server_jars.md#bukkit--a-z)** will be required. To ensure you have the best performance possible, we recommend using **[PaperMC](https://papermc.io/downloads)**.
<br>

## Server Version
Ultra Regions is supported on all versions (release) from **1.8.8 to 1.18.X**. Versions under 1.8 and every pre-release/snapshot will not receive any support.
<br>

**`NOTE:` Our plugins do not officially support offline-mode!**
<br>

# Download The Latest Build
Download the latest build of Ultra Regions via the resource page [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ultra-regions.58317/).
<br>

# Server installation
Once you have downloaded the latest version of Ultra Regions put its .jar file inside the `plugins` directory of your server.
<br>

**``NOTE:`` Make sure to stop the server before doing this.**
<br>

When the .jar has been uploaded you can now start your server.
<br>

When your server has been started there should be a new folder called Ultra Regions. This means that Ultra Regions has loaded properly and can now be used.
<br>

## Testing the plugin
If you have followed the steps above the plugin is now running. You can now use `/uregions`
