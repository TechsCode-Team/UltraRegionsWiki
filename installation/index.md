# Server Requirements
Ultra Regions requires **[Spigot](https://getbukkit.org/download/spigot)**, **[PaperMC](https://papermc.io/downloads)**, or **[any other fork](https://github.com/SpiritenHasArrived/MC/blob/main/Server_Side/server_jars.md#bukkit--a-z)** of spigot to run smoothly. We recommend using **PaperMC** to ensure the best possible performance.
<br>

## Server Version
Ultra Regions is supported on all versions (release) from **1.8.8 to 1.18.X**. Versions under 1.8 and every pre-release/snapshot will not receive any support.
