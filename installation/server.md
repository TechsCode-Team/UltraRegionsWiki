# Server installation
First step is to download Ultra Regions. Once you're done with this. `Stop your server`, and put the .jar file inside the `plugins` directory of your server.
<br>

Once the .jar has been uploaded in your folder, you can start your server.
<br>

Once your server has started, a new folder called Ultra Regions should have been created, inside the `plugins` directory. This means that Ultra Regions has loaded properly and can now be used.
<br>

## Testing the plugin
While your server is starting, look at the console for any possible [ERROR] message. Any [WARN] is not a problem, and will not disturb your use of the plugin.

You should now be able to do `/uregions` to open the GUI.

If you see a gui, that means you are good to go!
